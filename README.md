# FL-EMG
This repository is the Implementation of the Project "Federated Learning-Enhanced Edge Deep Learning Model for EMG-Based Gesture Recognition in Real-Time Human-Robot Interaction". The code for the training and testing of the FL based Proposed Model is attached. 
We are currently working on the expansion of the dataset and as soon as possible, we will upload the dataset.
